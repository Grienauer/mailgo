# ðŸ’Œ mailgo

_Unfortunately mailgo is not actively maintained anymore. I'm sorry for this but I personally don't have time to maintain it... I hope someone will take over the project._

## a new concept of `mailto` and `tel` links <https://mailgo.dev>

Transform all your `mailto` and `tel` link in a beautiful modal with more possibilities!
Open directly Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo for emails; Telegram, WhatsApp or Skype for phone numbers.
